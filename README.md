# Streamlit App for Testing Roboflow object Detection Models

This app allows you to upload an image to be inferenced by an Object Detection model trained with [Roboflow Train](https://docs.roboflow.com/train)
* [Inference: Hosted API](https://docs.roboflow.com/inference/hosted-api)
* [Response Object Format](https://docs.roboflow.com/inference/hosted-api#response-object-format)
* [Roboflow Python Package](https://docs.roboflow.com/python)
* [Roboflow Computer Vision Utilities](https://github.com/roboflow-ai/roboflow-computer-vision-utilities) - Learn how to customize inference results

The app might be [found here](https://mo-traor3-ai-streamlit-roboflow-model-test-streamlit-app-j8lako.streamlitapp.com/):

The app will work as is. If you want to build your own model, you'll need your own API key. [Create a Roboflow account](https://app.roboflow.com) to get your own API key.

Want to [build and deploy your own object detection model and app](https://blog.streamlit.io/how-to-use-roboflow-and-streamlit-to-visualize-object-detection-output/)? Follow the steps in our "How To" blog!

This app was created using [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com) and [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).
